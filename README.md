# MealFit

As I learn iOS development, I'm building a meal tracing app.
The purpose of MealFit is to record the foods that you eat so that you can
keep track of your daily macronutrient intake (calories, protein, carbs, fat).

The UI is build using storyboards in Interace Builder.

Since this is still in it's initial stages of development, the meal/food data
is hard-coded in the view controllers for quick developemnt of the UI.

## Requirements

* Xcode version 8.3.1
* Swift version 3.1
